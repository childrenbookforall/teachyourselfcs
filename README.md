# Teachyourselfcs
Group repo to hold our discussions, Summaries, Notes, Exercises etc. from material available at teachyourselfcs.com

Here is the plan (subject to change based on recommendations from other people):

- We will mostly be using books as a guide for the group. Though, individually we can use video material for our reference and learning. I personally feel that reading books give us better retention and recall than watching videos.

- There will be a cycle of 10-14 days, where we will target a chapter or section from the book. For every chapter, we will designate an individual to write the chapter or section summary. We will then hold discussions - which can be through text or through a video call.

- We will follow the same order which teachyourselfcs recommends unless the group decides otherwise for anything specific.

- We can choose to be connected individually or as a group through discord or telegram for real-time help.

This is a public repo. Please feel free to fork and add to the discussions or content here.
