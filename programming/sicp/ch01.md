# Chapter 1: Building Abstractions with Procedures

The chapter begins by quoting **John Locke** from *An Essay Concerning Human Understanding*. John talks about how mind exercises power over simple ideas in 3 ways: by combining several simple ideas into a complex one, by studying the relational aspects between two different ideas and by separating an idea from accompanying ideas to generalize it (called as abstraction).

We are then introduced to three concepts of computer science - computational process, data and program - in a very unique way. 
*Computational processes* are described as abstract beings (spirits) which inhabit computers and are capable of performing intellectual work. 
*Data* are abstract things which get manipulated by the computational processes. 
*Programs* are pattern of rules which direct and govern these computational processes.

Programmers then become sorcerers who write spells (programs) to summon the computational processes to do that tasks that they want to perform.
I love this analogy because through this learning to program becomes a little like learning to perform sorcery/magic. And the programming languages are different languages of spells which are used to tell the computational processes on what to do. The idea of robotic arms moving in factories or ATM machines dispensing cash does seem like magic.

We are then introduced to the programming language called **Lisp** and its history. Lisp was invented in 1950s by John McCarthy as a formalism to reason about use of *recursion equations*. It mainly delved in symbol manipulation for problems involving symbolic differentiation and integration. Lisp evolved experimentally to become a practical programming language. 

A machine which carries out the processes described in lisp language is called a lisp interpreter. There are several dialects of lisp now in popular use - clojure, common lisp, scheme etc. Lisp had issues of efficiency earlier but that has now largely been solved with the use of modern Lisp compilers which translate lisp programs into machine code more efficiently.

We are told that Lisp is a powerful language to learn programming because of some of its unique features. One of the powerful features of Lisp is how the ideas of procedures (description of processes) and data blur. Procedures can become data and data can become procedures. Procedures in lisp can be used to manipulate other procedures as if it were data - this makes it a good choice for writing programs where program manipulation is needed such as interpreters and compilers.

## Elements of Programming

Programming Languages are not only the means to provide instructions to a computer to perform different tasks, it should also provide to us a framework to organize our thoughts and ideas about different processes. The means that a programming language provides us to combine simple ideas into a complex one is very important. All powerful programs have three mechanisms that support this:
- primitive expressions - which represent the simplest entities that the language is concerned with
- means of combination - how compound elements are built using simpler elements.
- means of abstraction - how these compound elements can be named and manipulated as a unit

Any powerful programming language should have the means to describe primitive data and primitive procedures, and have ways for combining and abstracting procedures and data.

### Expressions

Numbers are a type of primitive data in lisp.
A number evaluates to itself.

+, -, \* and / are primitive procedures in lisp.

Primitive procedure and primitive data elements can be combined to make an expression called *combination*

```
(+ 56 42)
```
+ -> is called operator
56 and 42 are the operands

Lisp interpreter evaluates the value of the expression by applying the computational process describe in the operator to the operands.

We use the prefix notation is lisp which allows us to have any number of operands in an expression and also allows us to nest another combination expression within an operand infinitely.

```
(+ (* 3 4) (/ 6 2) (- 9 7))
```

For all expressions, Lisp interpreter operates in the same basic way - it reads the expression, evaluates it and prints the result (read, evaluate, print, loop - also called REPL).

### Naming the Environment

A powerful programming language should also provide a way to refer to computational objects using names. Name identifies a *variable* whose *value* is the object.

This is how Scheme dialect of lisp does it:

```
(define size 2)
```

This causes the lisp interpreter to associate the name *size* to the value 2.

**define** is the language's simplest means of abstraction. It allows for the use of simple names to represent even compound expressions.

```
(define r 10)
(define pi 3.14)
(define circumference (* 2 pi r))
```

To be able to associate a name to a value and later retrieve it, an interpreter maintains name-object pairs in some sort of memory - this is called an environment. A computational process can involve a number of different environments.

### Evaluating Combinations

To evaluate a combination, the lisp interpreter must also be following a procedure.
This could be the procedure for evaluating a combination:
1. evaluate the subexpressions of the combination.
2. apply the procedure that is the value of the leftmost subexpression(operator) to the values of the other subexpressions (operands).

Step 1 is recursive in nature here. The subexpression in the expression can also be a combination and the evaluation steps will be applied to them again - until we reach primitive operators or numerals or named objects.

The value of numerals are the numerals themselves. The value of primitive operators are the machine instruction sequences associated with those operators. The value of named objects are the objects associated with those names in the environment.
*The primitive operator is also a named object whose value is the sequence of machine instructions*

Evaluation of a combination can be visualised as a tree:

```
(* (+ 2 (* 4 6))
   (+ 3 5 7))
```

                                     390
                                    
                                  /   |        \
                                 *    26        15
                                     /|\      /\ /\
                                    + 2 24   + 3 5 7

Environment provides the context in which the evaluation of an expression happens.

The general evaluation rule described above does not apply to some special forms like *define*
