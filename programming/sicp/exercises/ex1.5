Exercise 1.5

```
(define (p) (p))

(define (test x y)
    (if (= x 0)
        0
        y))

(test 0 (p))
```

When applicative order evaluation is used, the interpreter will want to evaluate the value of (p).
(p) is defined in terms of (p) - the interpretor will run in an infinite loop and likely produce an error.

During normal order evaluation, we will never need to find the value of (p) - since the condition in the clause is true, 0 will be returned.
