# Exercise 1.4

```
(define (a-plus-abs-b a b)
    ((if (> b 0) + -) a b))
```

In this procedure the *if* construct is used to decide which operator will be used to operate on the operands a and b.
If b > 0, a is added to b (+ operator is chosen)
If b <=0, b is negative and it is subtracted from a (- operator is chosen)

Effectively the procedure produces **a + |b|** mathematically
